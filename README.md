Group 2

Module 20: Deliverable 1
 
Decide on a topic, source data, and perform exploratory data analysis.
- Flight delay and causes

- Using this data set, we are going to determine the causes for flight delays during COVID-19. This will include percent likelihood and causation.

### Communication Protocol
-	Team meets two to three times a week at class times and once on Friday
-	Main form of contact is Slack messaging
-	Contact team and or individuals, through Slack, with any specific questions on specific topics
-	Use of Gmail to share slides for presentation

## Analysis Topic and Reasoning
We have decided to examine a dataset of flights during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic (January to June 2020). We will be examining the percentage of flights that were delayed, and the primary causes of those delays (government restrictions, staffing shortages, mechanical issues, adverse weather, and others). We have all experienced these delays personally, or our close family or friends have been delayed and forced to book a new flight or forced to deal with an unexpected delay. We are attempting to determine if we can accurately predict delays before they happen.

## Data Set
We are going to be using the COVID-19 Airline Flight Delays and Cancelations data set from Kaggle.

https://www.kaggle.com/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations?select=jantojun2020.csv

This data set contains approximately 11 million flights and contains detailed flight delay and cancellation data. The United States Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks on time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. This data contains relevant flight information for our analysis; on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights.

## The questions we will answer:
We are attempting to predict the percentage likelihood of a flight being canceled by training a machine learning model with our data set. We are also looking to determine the largest causation of delay or cancelation with in our data set (i.e. staffing issues, mechanical issues, adverse weather, or something unexpected). We are also looking to determine the ideal time and day of the week to schedule a flight to avoid as many delays as possible. We may also attempt to add current weather data to our model to increase the accuracy of our model.
