Module 20: Deliverable 1

## Analysis Topic and Reasoning
	We have decided to examine a data set of flights during the COVID-19 pandemic (January to June 2020). We will be examining the percentage of flights that were delayed, and the primary causes of those delays (staffing shortages, mechanical issues, adverse weather, and others). We have all experienced these delays personally or our close family or friends have been delayed and forced to book a new flight or forced to deal with an unexpected delay. We are attempting to determine if we can accurately predict delays before they happen.

## Data Set
We are going to be using the COVID-19 Airline Flight Delays and Cancelations data set from Kaggle. 
![link] https://www.kaggle.com/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations?select=jantojun2020.csv
This data set contains approximately 11 million flights and contains detailed flight delay and cancellation data. The United States Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks on time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. This data contains relevant flight information for our analysis; on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights.

### The questions we will answer:
We are attempting to predict the percentage likelihood of a flight being canceled by training a machine learning model with our data set. We are also looking to determine the largest causation of delay or cancelation with in our data set, staffing issues, mechanical issues, adverse weather, or something unexpected. We are also looking to determine the ideal time and day of the week to schedule a flight to avoid as many delays as possible.
