# Individual Self Assessment

## Self-Assessment

For this final project, I was tasked with taking care of all of the aspects of machine learning model. I designed the model and created an outline of the model with generated data to show the basic outline. My teammates were kind enough to clean and encode the data that I needed for this model. I ran a logistic regression model on both of the delayed and cancelled flight datasets. This type of model performed rather poorly on the dataset and so I ran a random forest classifier model on both of the delayed and cancelled datasets. The random forest worked performed well on the cancelled data but more work needs to be done on the delayed data. The biggest challenge with this project was time, since this was a larger dataset to be running on a single machine, it took considerable time to run the model. With the shortened schedule that we as a team were faced with, it meant that there was less time in general to complete this project and even less time for the model to run. I would love to work more with this model to optimize and test it on other similar datasets. I had some help along the way with my teammates that helped me talk through logical problems and supported me when I got frustrated. I supported them by listening and offering advice  with each of their parts for this project. We had very open and honest communication with each other and worked well as a team, we always asked for help when we were stuck and problem solved together.

## Team Assessment

I am very thankful for this team, we were able to talk and collaborate with ease. We decided as a team to stick to our personal strengths and this worked very well. Everyone worked really hard and did what they promised to do. My only regret is that we didn't have more time to spend together. Our communication protocol, was that we would commmunicate over slack or zoom and be open about any problems or struggles. Luckily, there were very few problems regarding communication and when one person was struggling, another could step in. The strength of this team came from the same mindset, that we could only succede if we all worked together and a willingness to do whatever needed to get done. Finding ways to bring humor and small side antidotes really helped keep moral up when we got stressed. It was helpful to go over the rubric at the beginning of each week and go over who would be doing each part to get it all done.

## Summary of Project

This project was looking at the impact of COVID-19 on flights in the United States from January 2020 to June 2020. Looking at the changes in cancelled and delayed flights before the onset of COVID-19 and in the beginnings of the pandemic. A machine learning model (random forest classifier model) was used to see if cancelled and delayed flights could be predicted. It is much easier to predict if a flight will be cancelled than delayed and after the onset of COVID-19, more flights were cancelled and less flights delayed due to less flights in total.
